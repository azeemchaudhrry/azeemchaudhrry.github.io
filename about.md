I have over 5 years of experience as a senior software engineer and have worked at both small startups and large enterprise organizations. I’m a proficient full-stack developer, built multiple enterprises/in-house apps for Abu Dhabi Chamber, Microsoft, Macy’s and NCR.

I am looking for a challenging role where I can collaborate, learn, and grow with the responsibilities of architecture and project management. my motivation is the success of products and business growth, not technology. I enjoy experimenting with new technology and incorporate into my workflow when appropriate. I’m always interested in becoming a better technology nerd and meeting interesting people around the Globe.

Currently, I am working in UAE as a senior software engineer in one of the startups which mostly deals with Govt. projects from smaller to a larger scale. I’m constantly seeking out new projects.
