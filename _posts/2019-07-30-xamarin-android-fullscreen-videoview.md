During my current project I need to use the VideoView to play videos and add the ability to view the videos in full screen. So, I came across a good android library [fullscreen-video-view](https://github.com/dev-labs-bg/fullscreen-video-view).

 In Xamarin a nice feature of Binding Library is available to bind the native platform libraries to Xamarin.

The Xamarin Binding Project along with the sample Xamarin Android App is available here.
