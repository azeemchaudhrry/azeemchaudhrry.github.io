SkiaSharp is a 2D graphics system for .NET and C# powered by the open-source Skia graphics engine that is used extensively in Google products.

I came across a requirement creating a circular rotatable menu in a xamarin forms application. So, after a bit of R&D I found SkiaSharp can be used in Xamarin Forms for cross platform development.

I am writing about circular menu as well will share here in future.
